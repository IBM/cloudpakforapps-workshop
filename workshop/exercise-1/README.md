# Exercise 1: Introduction to Appsody and Codewind

In this exercise, we will introduce Appsody, which is the underpinning development flow in Kabanero, along with its integration into IDEs using Codewind. In particular you will become experienced with:

* the components of the Appsody development toolbox
* the concept of pre-configured "stacks" and templates for popular open source runtimes (such as Node.js and Spring Boot) on which to build applications
* the Appsody command-line interface to develop containerized applications, how to run and test them locally,

## Prerequisites

You should have already carried out the prerequisites defined in [Exercise 0](workshop/exercise-0/README.md). Check that you have access to the Appsody CLI by typing (the exact version number my be greater than shown below):

> **NOTE:** In the exercises that follow you will see the actual command to run, followed by a separate example of running the command with the expected output. You only need to run the first example and never need to run a command you see preceded by a "$". You can even use the copy button on the right side of the command to make copying easier.

```bash
appsody version
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
$ appsody version
appsody 0.4.10
```

## Steps

1. [Configure Appsody CLI](#1-configure-appsody-cli)
1. [Use Appsody CLI to build, test, run, and debug](#2-use-appsody-cli-to-build-test-run-and-debug)
1. [Appsody tasks on VS Code](#3-appsody-tasks-on-vs-code)
1. [Codewind on VS Code](#4-codewind-on-vs-code)

### 1. Configure Appsody CLI

In this section we'll configure our Appsody CLI to pull in Kabanero collections.

#### List existing Appsody stacks

The Appsody CLI gives you access to stacks, which are stored in stack repositories. These can be local, private to the Enterprise or public. To get the list of available repos, run this command.

```bash
appsody repo list
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
$ appsody repo list
NAME            URL
*incubator      https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/incubator-index.yaml
```

The exact repo list may be different to the above. `incubator` is one of the repos in the appsody project public hub (`appsodyhub`). For this workshop we are going to use the private enterprise-grade collection of stacks that come with Kabanero Enterprise (which is part of Cloud Pak for Applications). So the first thing we need to do is to tell the CLI about this.

#### Add Kabanero Collection to Appsody

From the Cloud Pak for Applications landing page get the `CollectionHub` URL, for example:

`https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/v0.1.2/kabanero-index.yaml`

Use the appsody CLI to add the Collection repo.

```bash
appsody repo add kabanero https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/v0.1.2/kabanero-index.yaml
```

Now when we get our list of repos, we should see Kabanero listed:

```bash
appsody repo list
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
$ appsody repo list
NAME            URL
*incubator      https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/incubator-index.yaml
kabanero        https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/v0.1.2/kabanero-index.yaml
```

We can now list the appsody stacks available in the Kabanero collection:

```bash
appsody list kabanero
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
$ appsody list kabanero
REPO        ID                  VERSION     TEMPLATES           DESCRIPTION
kabanero    java-microprofile   0.2.11      *default            Eclipse MicroProfile on Open Liberty & OpenJ9 using Maven
kabanero    java-spring-boot2   0.3.9       *default, kotlin    Spring Boot using OpenJ9 and Maven
kabanero    nodejs              0.2.5       *simple             Runtime for Node.js applications
kabanero    nodejs-express      0.2.5       *simple, skaffold   Express web framework for Node.js
kabanero    nodejs-loopback     0.1.4       *scaffold           LoopBack 4 API Framework for Node.js
```

Given that we'll exclusively be using the kabanero stacks in this workshop, for each of use we can set the kabanero repository to be the default for the CLI:

```bash
appsody repo set-default kabanero
```

Now is we get the list of repos, we should see kabanero is the default:

```bash
appsody repo list
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
$ appsody repo list
NAME            URL
*kabanero       https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/v0.1.2/kabanero-index.yaml
incubator       https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/latest/download/incubator-index.yaml
```

### 2. Use Appsody CLI to build, test, run, and debug

In this section we'll be using the following appsody commands:

* `appsody init`
* `appsody run`
* `appsody test`
* `appsody debug`
* `appsody build`

#### Create a new directory to work with new applications

We recommend creating a new directory from your user home to work with new Appsody based applications, i.e.:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir appsody-apps
cd appsody-apps
```

#### Create a new application

We will now use on of the stacks to create an application. First, create a new directory for the project and change directory into it.

```bash
mkdir appsody_sample_nodejs-express
cd appsody_sample_nodejs-express/
```

Initialize the project using `appsody init`:

```bash
appsody init kabanero/nodejs-express
```

The directory has been initialized with a minimal set of artifacts (which is, in fact, a sample application that uses the chosen stack)

```bash
.
├── .appsody-config.yaml
├── .gitignore
├── .vscode
│  ├── launch.json
│  └── tasks.json
├── app.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── test
    └── test.js
```

The key artifacts are:

* app.js
  Node.js application module (the default sample application is a simple "hello world")

* package.json
  NPM package JSON file

* test.js
  A simple test module

#### Run the application

The sample application comes ready to run using appsody:

```bash
appsody run
```

This step results in the stack image, with the sample application mounted into it, run in you local Docker environment. The output has the endpoint for the application.

```bash
Running development environment...

```

We can now check that this is running by hitting the endpoint <http://localhost:3000>:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:3000
Hello from Appsody!
```

By default, the template sample application also provides the following endpoints.

* Readiness endpoint: <http://localhost:3000/ready>
* Liveness endpoint: <http://localhost:3000/live>
* Health check endpoint: <http://localhost:3000/health>
* Metrics endpoint: <http://localhost:3000/metrics>

For more details on this particular stack, refer to [Node.js Express
Stack](https://github.com/appsody/stacks/blob/master/incubator/nodejs-express/README.md).

#### Stop the application

To stop the application container, run this command from the same directory (e.g. in another terminal window):

```bash
appsody stop
```

Alternatively, you can also press `Ctrl+C` in the first window that is running the application.

#### Test the application

A stack will typically come with a test framework - and this can be initiated by running:

```bash
appsody test
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
$ appsody test
Running test environment

```

#### Debug the application

As well as supporting the running and testing of your application, an appsody stack enables the execution of your application in debug mode. Typically the stack will be configured to support whatever the appropriate debugger is for the language and technology components within it.

Open your editor. We are using `VS Code`. Add the project to your workspace, or use the command `code .`

![Initialized Appsody code](images/js_lab1_vscode_project.png)

Open a new terminal window inside VS Code use `View` -> `Terminal`

![Open the embedded terminal](images/js_lab1_vscode_terminal.png)

To debug the application including reloading the application on code changes run the below command:

```bash
appsody debug
```

The output indicates the debug environment is being used

```bash
Running debug environment
Running command: docker pull kabanero/nodejs-express:0.2

```

Now you can again open the application at <http://localhost:3000/>

![The application running in debug mode](images/js_lab1_endpoint.png)

Update the message and save the change.

![Change the message](images/js_lab1_code_change.png)

The debugger will now rebuild the container and reload the application for you.

Refresh the browser to see the changes:

![The application running with the new changes](images/js_lab1_endpoint_test.png)

You can attach to the Node.js debugger using VS Code. To access the debug view use `View` -> `Debug` or click Debug icon on left menu:

![Open the embedded debugger](images/js_lab1_vscode_debug.png)

Add a breakpoint to the application, click to the left of the line number:

![Add a breakpoint](images/js_lab1_vscode_breakpoint.png)

Click on the debug task `Appsody: Attach node` and click the `Play` button:

![Attach the debugger to Appsody](images/js_lab1_vscode_attach.png)

Refresh the browser and watch how the debugger stops at the breakpoint:

![The debugger in action](images/js_lab1_vscode_attach_break.png)

#### Build the application

Up until now, we have been using appsody in what we call "Rapid Local Development Mode", where we can cycle round code changes, testing and debugging them - all within a local Docker environment. Appsody is making this environment possible, through a combination of the CLI, the stack and appsody code within that stack. Once you are ready to deploy the application outside of appsody control, there are two additional appsody commands to help you.

These enable a couple of capabilities:

* support for building a standalone docker image (containing your application and the stack technologies), that can be deployed either using regular Docker commands, or manually to a kubernetes cluster.
* support deploying the final image directly to a kubernetes cluster, under control of the Appsody Operator. We will cover deployment in [Exercise 3](workshop/exercise-3/README.md).

In this section we will carry out the first of these - i.e. simply building a standalone image. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is enacted by:

```bash
appsody build
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
$ appsody build
.
.
.

[Docker] Successfully tagged appsody-sample-nodejs-express:latest
Built docker image appsody-sample-nodejs-express
```

We now have a standalone image (independant of appsody), we can view the image using our local Docker environment:

```bash
docker images
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                  TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

```

We can run this with our local Docker environment in the normal way (making sure we map the exposed port):

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 appsody-sample-nodejs-express
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 appsody-sample-nodejs-express
...
> nodejs-express@0.2.6 start /project
> node server.js
...
[Tue Oct  1 19:49:45 2019] com.ibm.diagnostics.healthcenter.loader INFO: Node Application Metrics 5.0.5.201910011945 (Agent Core 4.0.5)
[Tue Oct  1 19:49:46 2019] com.ibm.diagnostics.healthcenter.mqtt INFO: Connecting to broker localhost:1883
App started on PORT 3000
```

Again, hitting the endpoint of <http://localhost:3000/> should give us the hello message.

You now have seen the basics of the appsody CLI in operation. We'll now take things up a level, and see how the CLI can be integrated into an IDE (VS Code in this case).

### 3. Appsody tasks on VS Code

To access the build tasks on VS code, go to: `Terminal` > `Run Build Task`...

![View Build Tasks](images/js_lab1_build_task_menu.png)

You will see a list of available tasks:

![List of possible tasks](images/js_lab1_build_task_list.png)

Click on `Appsody: run` and this will run the application:

![Choose `Appsody: run`](images/js_lab1_build_task_run.png)

Once it is successfully started, you can, again, access the application at <http://localhost:3000/>:

![View the running app, again](images/js_lab1_endpoint.png)

You can also run the `Appsody: stop` task:

![Choose `Appsody: stop`](images/js_lab1_build_task_stop.png)

### 4. Codewind on VS Code

Codewind simplifies and enhances development in containers by extending industry-standard IDEs with features to write, debug, and deploy cloud-native applications. It helps you to get started quickly with templates or samples, or you can also pull in your applications and let Codewind get them cloud-ready.

Codewind supports VS Code, Eclipse Che, and Eclipse. In this lab, we are using VS Code as our IDE.

#### Getting the Codewind extension

To get codewind extension you need [VS Code version 1.28 or later](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Go to the extensions view and search for `Codewind` from the VS Code marketplace:

![Codewind extensions](images/js_lab1_vscode_codewind_extension.png)

You will find `Codewind` then click `install` to get it. Also, if you want to use Codewind for Node.js performance analysis, you need to install `Codewind Node.js Profiler`.

Once installed, in VS Code, go to `View` > `Open View` ...

![Open a new view](images/sb_lab1_vscode_view.png)

It gives you you a list of options. Select `Codewind`:

![Choose the Codewind option](images/sb_lab1_vscode_code_explorer.png)

This opens `Codewind`:

![Codewind menu](images/sb_lab1_vscode_codewind_explorer.png)

#### Adding the application

You can create a new project or add an existing project to Codewind. Since, we already created one using appsody earlier, we can add the existing project.

Right click on `Projects` under Codewind. Select `Add Existing Project` in the menu:

![Choose to add an existing project](images/sb_lab1_codewind_add_existing_project.png)

> **NOTE** Before doing this, copy your project to the codewind workspace, in the directory `codewind-workspaces/` in your HOME directory. At this point in time, codewind only accepts the projects that are available in the `codewind workspace`.

From the codewind workspace, select the project you created earlier:

![Add our project to Codewind](images/js_lab1_add_existing_prj_from_workspace.png)

The codewind extension asks you for confirmation as follows. Click `Yes`. The project will be added.

Once it is successfully built, it starts running:

![App will build and run](images/js_lab1_appsody_project_running.png)

You can open the CodeWind workspace, right click on `Projects`:

![Open the CodeWind workspace](images/js_lab1_codewind_open_workspace.png)

#### Project options

Go to the application and `right click` on it to access the various options available:

![Access options](images/js_lab1_codewind_project_options.png)

Click `Open App` to access the application:

![Open the application](images/js_lab1_codewind_open_app.png)

> **NOTE** Codewind exposes your applications on different external ports. This will allow you to run multiple projects of same type.

To get the overview of your project, click on `Open Project Overview`:

![Project overview](images/js_lab1_codewind_project_overview.png)

 You can access the container shell directly from the IDE by using `Open Container Shell`:

![Container shell](images/js_lab1_codewind_container_shell.png)

To access the logs of the application, click on `Show all logs`:

![Application logs](images/js_lab1_codewind_project_logs.png)

You can also hide the logs if you want to by using `Hide all logs` option:

If you have multiple applications and want to manage the logs for them, you can use `Manage logs`:

You can also run the application by using `Restart in Run Mode`:

![Run the application](images/js_lab1_codewind_project_restart_in_run_mode.png)

Once it is restarted, you can access the application by clicking on the button as shown below:

![Open the application](images/js_lab1_restart_in_run_mode_app.png)

Similarly, you can also do debugging by using `Restart in Debug Mode`.

#### Application Performance, Monitor, Profiling with Codewind

You can launch the app monitor by selecting `Open Appplication Monitor`:

![Open application monitor](images/js_lab1_codewind_app_monitor.png)

The monitor dashboard will open in the browser:

![View the dashboard](images/js_lab1_app_monitor_dashboard.png)

You can launch the app performance dashboard by selecting `Open Performance Dashboard`:

![Open application performance](images/js_lab1_app_performance.png)

The performance dashboard will open in the browser:

![View the performance dashboard](images/js_lab1_app_performance_dashboard.png)

You can click Run Test and have Monitor and Performance dashboards side by side during the test:

![Run test and monitor results](images/js_lab1_app_side_by_side_perf_test.png)

> **NOTE:** Profiling the node.js code is currently not working, an [issue](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind/issues/533) is opened on the github repo for the codewind node.js profiler extension.
