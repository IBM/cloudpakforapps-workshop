# Exercise 4: Use Tekton and Kabanero Pipelines to continuously deploy

In this exercise we're going to take our insurance quote application from exercise 3 and instead of deploying it as a stand alone app, we will push the code up to a GitHub repo and use Tekton pipelines to constantly deploy the app to our OpenShift cluster and speed up your deployment process.

Recall that the application from exercise 3 consists of:

* a front-end constructed with Node.js (we used the `nodejs-express` collection)
* a back-end constructed with Java (we used the `java-spring-boot2` collection)

When you have completed this exercise, you will understand how to:

* Leverage Tekton pipelines with Kabanero collections to deploy applications to OpenShift

## Prerequisites

You should have already carried out the prerequisites defined in [Exercise 3](workshop/exercise-3/README.md), and in addition:

First we delete the deployments, run the `appsody deploy delete` command to remove them.

```bash
cd ~/appsody-apps/quote-frontend
appsody deploy delete --namespace insurance-quote
cd ~/appsody-apps/quote-backend
appsody deploy delete --namespace insurance-quote
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
$ appsody deploy delete --namespace insurance-quote
Deleting deployment using deployment manifest app-deploy.yaml
Attempting to delete resource from Kubernetes...
Running command: kubectl delete -f app-deploy.yaml --namespace insurance-quote
Deployment deleted
```

Note, we still have the `insurance-quote` namespace, the `dacadoo-config` config map, the `appsody-operator` deployment, and the images in our registry.

## Steps

1. [Launch the Tekton dashboard](#1-launch-the-tekton-dashboard)
1. [Get a GitHub Access Token](#2-get-a-github-access-token)
1. [Upload insurance quote frontend, and backend to GitHub](#3-upload-insurance-quote-frontend-and-backend-to-gitHub)
1. [Add webhooks to Tekton](#4-add-webhooks-to-tekton)
1. [Test it all out](#5-test-it-all-out)

### 1. Launch the Tekton dashboard

You can the tekton dashboard from Cloud Pak for Apps.

![Launch Tekton](images/launch_tekton.png)

You can also obtain the URL for the tekton dashboard by using `oc get routes`. We want to use the address that looks like `tekton-dashboard-kabanero.xyz.domain.containers.appdomain.cloud`.

```bash
$ oc get routes --namespace kabanero
NAME               HOST/PORT                                                                                                             PATH      SERVICES           PORT      TERMINATION          WILDCARD
icpa-landing       ibm-cp-applications.cpa-workshop-dev-5290c8c8e5797924dc1ad5d1b85b37c0-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud                   icpa-landing       <all>     reencrypt/Redirect   None
kabanero-cli       kabanero-cli-kabanero.cpa-workshop-dev-5290c8c8e5797924dc1ad5d1b85b37c0-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud                 kabanero-cli       <all>     passthrough          None
kabanero-landing   kabanero-landing-kabanero.cpa-workshop-dev-5290c8c8e5797924dc1ad5d1b85b37c0-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud             kabanero-landing   <all>     passthrough          None
tekton-dashboard   tekton-dashboard-kabanero.cpa-workshop-dev-5290c8c8e5797924dc1ad5d1b85b37c0-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud             tekton-dashboard   <all>     reencrypt/Redirect   None
```

#### Review pre-installed pipelines and tasks on Cloud Pak for Apps

There are 5 **Pipelines**, one for each collection kabanero comes with (java microprofile, spring, nodejs, express, and loopback). **Pipelines** are a first class structure in Tekton. **Pipelines** are a series of **Tasks**.

Run this command to see the available pipelines.

```bash
oc get pipeline -n kabanero
```

You will see something similar to this.

```bash
$ oc get pipeline -n kabanero
NAME                                           AGE
java-microprofile-build-deploy-pipeline        15d
java-spring-boot2-build-deploy-pipeline        15d
nodejs-build-deploy-pipeline                   15d
nodejs-express-build-deploy-pipeline           15d
nodejs-loopback-build-deploy-pipeline          15d
pipeline0                                      15d
```

These are visible through the UI, too:

![Pre-Existing Pipelines](images/tekton_pipelines.png)

There are 10 **Tasks**, two for each collection kabanero comes with. Each collection has 2 **Tasks**, a *Build Task* and a *Deploy Task*.

```bash
oc get pipeline -n kabanero
```

You will see something similar to this.

```bash
$ oc get tasks -n kabanero
NAME                            AGE
java-microprofile-build-task    27d
java-microprofile-deploy-task   27d
java-spring-boot2-build-task    27d
java-spring-boot2-deploy-task   27d
monitor-result-task             27d
nodejs-build-task               27d
nodejs-deploy-task              27d
nodejs-express-build-task       27d
nodejs-express-deploy-task      27d
nodejs-loopback-build-task      27d
nodejs-loopback-deploy-task     27d
pipeline0-task                  27d
```

These are visible through the UI, too:

![Pre-Existing Tasks](images/tekton_tasks.png)

### 2. Update Kabanero to deploy to alternate namespaces with Tekton

Find the kabanero custom resource

```bash
$ oc get kabaneros -n kabanero
NAME       AGE       VERSION   READY
kabanero   13d       0.1.0     True
```

Edit the kabanero custom resource

```bash
oc edit kabaneros kabanero -n kabanero
```

Add a `targetNamespaces` key to `spec` with value `insurance-quote`:

```yaml
spec:
  collections:
    repositories:
    - activateDefaultCollections: true
      name: incubator
      url: https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/v0.1.2/kabanero-index.yaml
  targetNamespaces:
  - insurance-quote
```

#### Update `app-deploy.yml` to specify the namespace

Go to your frontend code `cd ~/appsody-apps/quote-frontend` and update `app-deploy.yaml` to include the `namespace`

```yaml
apiVersion: appsody.dev/v1beta1
kind: AppsodyApplication
metadata:
  name: quote-frontend
  namespace: insurance-quote
```

Go to your backend code `cd ~/appsody-apps/quote-backend` and update `app-deploy.yaml` to include the `namespace`

```yaml
apiVersion: appsody.dev/v1beta1
kind: AppsodyApplication
metadata:
  name: quote-backend
  namespace: insurance-quote
```

### 2. Get a GitHub Access Token

When using Tekton, building a pipeline will require code to be pulled from either a public or private repository. When configuring Tekton, for security reasons, we will create an *Access Token* instead of using a password.

To create an *Access Token*, from [Github.com](Github.com) click on your profile icon in the top left. Then go to `Settings` -> `Developer Settings` -> `Personal Access Tokens`. Or go directly to <https://github.com/settings/tokens>

![Choose to create a new Access Token](images/github_access_tokens.png)

Here we want to generate a token, so `Click` on the `Generate a Token`. The token permissions need to be the `repo` which gives read and write access to the repository.

![Generate a new Access Token](images/github_create_token.png)

Once the token is created, make sure to copy it down. We will need it later.

### 3. Upload insurance quote frontend, and backend to GitHub

Go to <https://github.com/new> and create two new repositories, `quote-frontend`, and `quote-backend`. Do not initiatize the repos with a license file or README.

![New repo](images/new_repo.png)

From your `quote-backend` directory, run the commands below, replacing `<username>` with your own.

```bash
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/quote-backend.git
git push -u origin master
```

The repo for your backend code should look like this:

![Repo for backend](images/repo_backend.png)

From your `quote-frontend` directory, run the commands below, replacing `<username>` with your own.

```bash
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/quote-frontend.git
git push -u origin master
```

The repo for your frontend code should look like this:

![Repo for frontend](images/repo_frontend.png)

### 4. Add webhooks to Tekton to watch Github repo changes

Configure the GitHub webhook to your repo. Go to `Webhooks` > `Add Webhook` and then create the webhook.

![new webhook options](images/create-tekton-webhook.png)

Note that the first time creating a webhook a new access token must also be created, use the access token from the earlier step:

![Create an access token](images/create-token.png)

#### Create a webhook for the backend

```ini
Name: backend-webhook
Repository URL: http://github.com/{username}/quote-backend
Access Token: github-tekton

Namespace: kabanero
Pipeline: java-spring-boot2-build-deploy-pipeline
Service account: kabanero-operator
Docker Registry: docker-registry.default.svc:5000/insurance-quote
```

#### Create a webhook for the frontend

```ini
Name: frontend-webhook
Repository URL: http://github.com/{username}/quote-frontend
Access Token: github-tekton

Namespace: kabanero
Pipeline: nodejs-express-build-deploy-pipeline
Service account: kabanero-operator
Docker Registry: docker-registry.default.svc:5000/insurance-quote
```

Verify both are created successfully.

![the webhooks exist](images/both-tekton-webhooks.png)

#### Check Github repo settings

Go to the repo and check the settings tab to see the webhooks, Click the webhook

![Webhook overview](images/github-webhook-overview.png)

Scroll down to see any payloads being delivered. There is currently a bug where the first payload is not delivered. Not to worry, we'll be making changes to the code anyway, that will trigger a new payload.

![Webhook payload](images/webhook-payload.png)

### 5. Test it all out

In your `quote-backend` repo, change the file `quote-backend/src/main/java/application/Quote.java`. Change a value in a logger statement.

This will trigger the tekton pipleine. Go to the tekton dashboard and access the new pipeline it created.

![See the java deploy pipeline](images/view-tasks.png)

Wait until the task is complete, then find the route using `oc get routes`:

```bash
$ oc get routes -n insurance-quote | grep backend
quote-backend   quote-backend-insurance-quote.cp4apps-workshop-prop-5290c8c8e5797924dc1ad5d1b85b37c0-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud
```

In your `quote-frontend` repo, change the file `app-deploy.yml` to update the `BACKEND_URL` value with the URL from the previous step.

```yaml
  env:
  - name: BACKEND_URL
    value: http://quote-backend-insurance-quote.cp4apps-workshop-prop-5290c8c8e5797924dc1ad5d1b85b37c0-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/quote
```

This should trigger another pipeline to be created, using the node-express pipeline.

![Two PipelineRuns should appear](images/view-pipelines.png)

Wait until the task is complete, then find the route using `oc get routes`:

```bash
$ oc get routes -n insurance-quote | grep frontend
quote-frontend     quote-frontend-insurance-quote.cp4apps-workshop-prop-5290c8c8e5797924dc1ad5d1b85b37c0-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud
```

Open a browser to `http://<url-from-above>` and see the usual interface for the insurance quote app. Try entering information to ensure the frontend and backend are communicating.
