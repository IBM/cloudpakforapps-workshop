# Workshop Day 1

## Day 1: Kabanero and Appsody for Developers and Operators

In this first day we'll learn how to use Appsody to run the *inner loop* of the development and test cycle for a developer.

We'll also explore how to deploy an application to OpenShift, first manually with Appsody for dev/test purposes, and then using the standard Kabanero Tekton piplines with GitOps as part of a continual test/production cycle.

Our goal for the end of the day is represented below. But, don't worry about it right now, we'll get there together by following the exercises step-by-step.
