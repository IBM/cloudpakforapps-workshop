## Creating Cloud Native Applications with Cloud Pak for Applications on OpenShift

Welcome to our workshop! In this workshop we'll be using the Cloud Pak for Applications platform to create Cloud Native Applications that run on OpenShift. The goals of this workshop are:

* Use Appsody and Codewind to create a cloud native application
* Create a custom Collection
* Use Tekton CI to continuously deploy to OpenShift

## Agenda

### Day 1: Kabanero and Appsody for Developers and Operators

In this first day we'll learn how to use Appsody to run the *inner loop* of the development and test cycle for a developer. We'll also explore how to deploy an application to OpenShift, first manually with Appsody for dev/test purposes, and then using the standard Kabanero Tekton piplines with GitOps as part of a continual test/production cycle.

| Section | Description |
| - | - |
| **[Lecture 1: Kabanero Overview](https://ibm.box.com/s/6jl4b7sj8xqgh7rvxtea5ykpsjyu1siz)** | Learn about Kabanero. An open source project to rapidly create Cloud Native applications |
| **[Exercise 1: Introduction to Appsody](../exercise-1/README.md)** | Install the Appsody component of Kabanero, Learn about the developer flow, building your first application with Appsody |
| **[Exercise 2: Using Appsody CLI to develop, test, and debug applications](../exercise-2/README.md)** | Use the Appsody CLI to quickly create frontend and backend applications for a sample application using two different technologies (Spring and nodejs express) |
| **[Lecture 3: Adding value with IBM Cloud Pak for Applications](https://ibm.box.com/s/y4wh104vdos1vw5kdjwwuhebf8jgq580)** | Learn about how IBM Cloud Pak for Applications bundles everything together |
| **[Exercise 3: Deploying to OpenShift with Appsody](../exercise-3/README.md)** | Deploy the built applications to IBM Managed OpenShift with Appsody for dev/test purposes |

### Day 2: Customizing Stacks, Pipelines in Collections

In the second day we'll learn about the Kabanero open source project and how to productionize our applications with custom Appsody Stacks, custom Collections, and custom Tekton pipelines.

| Section | Description |
| - | - |
| **[Lecture 4: Customizing Appsody and Kabanero](https://ibm.box.com/s/kbuympaqftxswyi1aoswdlqussmqf1ba)** | Learn about the stacks and repos |
| **[Exercise 5: Customizing an existing Appsody Stack](../exercise-5/README.md)** | Create a custom stack, to be hosted in our custom repository |
| **[Exercise 6: Building a custom Collection](../exercise-6/README.md)** | Create a collection that will contain custom appsody stacks and pipelines |
| **[Lecture 5: Tekton Overview](https://ibm.box.com/s/tg0f6nhs91trlzkb5pfnh5e1rdzg4wm6)** | Learn about Tekton CI/CD and how Kabanero uses it |
| **[Exercise 9: Deploy an application with a custom Stack, custom Collection, and custom Pipeline](../exercise-9/README.md)** | Build and deploy an application using the custom stack, collection and pipelines built by the Architects' and Operators' tracks |

## Compatability
